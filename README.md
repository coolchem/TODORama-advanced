[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/coolchem/TODORama/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/coolchem/TODORama?branch=master) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/coolchem/TODORama.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/coolchem/TODORama)

It is a Simple TODO app based of the [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) guideline which helps developers to choose framework, based on the ease of implementation of exact same TODO application in different frameworks.

This project is an advanced version of [TODORama](https://github.com/coolchem/TODORama) Project.

Purpose of this project is to showcase some new and advanced capabilities of RamaJS, like building Components and Skins, using multiple transcludes etc.
 
Using these capabilities one can create advanced reusable components and compose them to create scalable and maintainable large scale applications.
